        <h3> My name is Jervin Idjiran  </h3>
        <p>Hello ! I'm an aspiring Electrical Engineer on a journey to illuminate the world, one circuit at a time. With a curious mind and a knack for problem-solving, I thrive on deciphering the language of electrons and translating it into innovative solutions. From tinkering with intricate circuitry to unraveling the secrets of electromagnetic waves. I'm fueled by the buzz of possibilities that electricity brings. When I'm not lost in the world of resistors and capacitors, you'll find me powering up my creativity through reading self help books, playing video games, and doing programming.</p>

            <h3>VIDEO GAMES AND PROGRAMMING</h3>
            <p>As a child I always wonder how games are made,how a character jumping in a small screen killing monster mushroom, and how to make one. As I grew older I realize that making games is not that simple. you need to have a good foundation in math and physics just to build a complex game, but it does not stop me from doing what I like.
                programming and gaming are inextricably linked. Video games are the physical results of complex programming, where lines of instructions and algorithms give virtual worlds life. Programming languages, the heart of these interactive narratives, are used to precisely organize every pixel, every action, and every decision.

                Video games are engrossing instructional resources that introduce players to basic programming ideas in an entertaining setting. Games like Roblox and Minecraft provide players the freedom to design, alter, and experiment with virtual worlds while unintentionally teaching kids the fundamentals of logical coding and problem-solving.

                Moreover, programming innovation has been sparked by the development of gaming hardware and software. The demands of generating immersive gaming experiences have pushed the limits of processing power, resulting in breakthroughs that pervade many other industries, from graphics rendering to artificial intelligence. The same level of immersion that gaming provides is what programming benefits from. Programmers weave logic and create solutions, much way game designers create captivating experiences. Whether it's designing a gaming mechanic that responds to player interaction or debugging code to ensure a seamless user experience, both fields require innovation to overcome complicated problems.
            Video games and programming are interwoven threads in the tapestry of human inventiveness, each complementing and elevating the other. The relationship between pixels and code, controllers and keyboards, is clear and serves as a monument to the complex dance between technology and human ingenuity. We uncover the incredible story of how gaming and programming come together as we continue to explore the universes created by both sectors. This process propels us into a future in which the distinction between the virtual and the real blurs into a symphony of limitless possibilities.</p>

            <h3>CODE AND ENGINEERING</h3>
            <p>As a very curious person, I tend to stumble on a rabbit hole of information. Where in a bunch of fun thing to mess with and ideas to form in a single search of a specific topic. as an electrical engineering student myself and a person who have a little bit of knowledge in coding 
                The modern world is being shaped by two key partners: engineering and code. The symbiotic relationship between engineering, the art of creating workable solutions, and coding, the language of computers, fosters creativity, advances society, and reframes what is possible for people to do. explores the dynamic interaction between engineering and coding, revealing how both fields cooperate to turn concepts into reality.
                Engineering tasks are guided by coding, which acts as a digital blueprint. Concrete functions are created from abstract concepts by programmers through carefully crafted lines of code. Coding fills the gap between design and implementation in engineering projects, giving complex systems from spacecraft to bridges life.

Engineers may model and evaluate their designs using code, predicting real-world behavior and helping them make defensible conclusions. Engineers can test out many scenarios, foresee problems, and hone answers before actual building ever starts thanks to coding's adaptability.
Lines of code are used to automate repetitive activities, expanding the use of coding in engineering. This interplay improves accuracy and efficiency, lowering human error and streamlining procedures. Coding is a language that engineers use to regulate manufacturing operations, program robots, and even automate complex medical procedures.

Engineers can also gain useful insights from data by using coding. Engineers can increase the efficiency of their designs by identifying trends using algorithms and data analysis. Coding's accuracy guarantees that engineering solutions are not only functional but also carefully honed to satisfy particular needs.
        as of the moment I do not possess this such intelligent to apply such greater feat in this line of work, but I do know if I grind and strive to get want I want, I can finally achieve something that might help.  </p>
